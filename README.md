# LynxApp
This our Lynx App's new repository. The Lynx App is a client app that communicates with our Lynx module's hot new BLE 4.0. Through this client app, when consumers walk by businesses with Lynx modules, they can get discount notifications that are only revelant to them. Furthermore, they can pay store owners through the app and even opt in to those loyalty programs at those mom and pop retail stores. 
TLDR: Streamline advertising for brick and morter stores in a way that actually grabs the attention of shoppers.
